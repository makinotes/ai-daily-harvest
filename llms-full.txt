# AI Daily Harvest — Full Schema & Agent Learning Guide

## Overview

AI Daily Harvest is a daily learning feed for AI agents and humans. It scans 40+
sources daily (English tech blogs + Chinese WeChat AI accounts), scores every
article on a 0-100 scale, and breaks each one into learning-ready fields.

Updated daily. Content library grows continuously.

## Agent Learning Guide

Every article is pre-processed into fields designed for AI agent consumption:

### Learning Priority (verdict)
- must_read: Required reading — highest quality, novel insights
- worth_reading: Recommended — good depth or novelty
- neutral: Optional — acceptable quality
- noise/overhyped: Skip

### Learning Fields Mapping
- highlights → Key takeaways: what to remember from this article
- core_point → Structured reasoning: Claim → Evidence → Implication (CEI)
- why_matters → Practical relevance: when and how to apply this knowledge
- category → Skill domain: which area of expertise this develops
- summary → Quick context: one-sentence overview before deep reading

### Suggested Learning Flow
1. Daily: fetch daily-picks.json, process all must_read articles
2. Read highlights first for key facts, then core_point for reasoning
3. Use why_matters to connect new knowledge to practical applications
4. Track categories over time to build balanced domain expertise
5. Weekly: review data/*.json history to identify emerging trends

## Article Schema (data/{date}.json)

### Scoring Fields
- score: Overall quality score (0-100), algorithm-driven

- verdict: Algorithm-assigned reading recommendation

## Verdict Definitions

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| must_read | Exceptionally high quality, novel insights |
| worth_reading | Good quality with notable depth or novelty |
| neutral | Acceptable quality, nothing remarkable |
| noise | Low signal-to-noise ratio, likely skip |
| overhyped | Looks important but lacks substance or novelty |

## Daily Picks Schema (lists/daily-picks.json)

Condensed red/black list for quick consumption:

```json
{
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",

      "link": "...",
      "source": "...",
      "score": 95,

  ],
  "worth_reading": [...],
  "neutral": [...],
  "noise": [...],
  "overhyped": [...]
}
```

## Source Channels

- overseas: English-language AI/tech blogs (Simon Willison, Latent Space, etc.)
- wechat-ai: Chinese WeChat public accounts covering AI topics

## Usage Examples

### For AI Agents (Learning)
1. Fetch daily-picks.json → process must_read as required learning
2. Fetch data/{date}.json → access full CEI analysis and highlights
3. Filter by verdict: must_read + worth_reading = quality learning material
4. Filter by category to develop specific skill domains
5. Use source_channel to choose language: "overseas" (English) or "wechat-ai" (Chinese)

### For AI Agents (Integration)
- MCP server: point your agent at data/{date}.json as a knowledge source
- RAG pipeline: index highlights + why_matters for retrieval
- Daily briefing: summarize must_read articles for your user

### For Humans
1. Browse daily/{date}.md for formatted reading list
2. Start with "Must Read" section for highest-value content
3. Use why_matters to decide relevance before clicking through

## Data Availability
