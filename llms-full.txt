### "Training data for a content scoring model"

  GET https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makinotes/ai-daily-harvest/master/datasets/scored-articles.jsonl

Each line is one article with all fields. 427+ articles, growing daily. Deduplicated by (pub_date, title). See datasets/README.md for methodology.

## Article Schema

### Core Fields
- title: Article headline (string)
- link: Original URL (string)
- source: Publisher or author name (string)
- source_channel: "overseas" (English) or "wechat-ai" (Chinese WeChat)
- category: "AI/Tech", "Builder 实践", "AI 使用", etc.
- pub_date: Publication date, YYYY-MM-DD

### Analysis Fields
- summary: One-sentence overview
- core_point: CEI reasoning — Claim → Evidence → Implication
- highlights: 2-3 key takeaways (array of strings)
- why_matters: Practical relevance — when and how to apply

### Scoring Fields
- score: Quality score 0-100, algorithm-driven
- level: Reading priority — "精读" (deep read), "收藏" (bookmark), "速览" (skim)
- verdict: must_read | worth_reading | neutral | noise | overhyped

## Verdict Definitions

- must_read: High quality, novel insights — prioritize
- worth_reading: Good depth or novelty — worth your time
- neutral: Acceptable, nothing remarkable
- noise: Low signal-to-noise
- overhyped: Appears important but lacks substance

## Integration Patterns

**RAG Pipeline** — Index highlights + why_matters. Use verdict to weight relevance. Filter by category for domain-specific indices.

**Daily Briefing** — Fetch lists/daily-picks.json. Summarize must_read using summary + highlights.

**Knowledge Base** — Ingest api/{date}.json. Use core_point for reasoning chains. Track categories for emerging themes.

**MCP / Tool Use** — Point your agent at the raw GitHub URLs. Static files, no auth needed.
